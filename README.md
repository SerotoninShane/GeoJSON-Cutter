# GeoJSON Polygon Hole Subtraction Tool

A Node.js script that processes GeoJSON polygons by subtracting "hole" polygons from a main polygon. This is useful for creating complex polygon shapes with cutouts for use in eCanvasser or other mapping applications.

## What This Script Does

The script takes a GeoJSON file containing multiple polygon features and:
1. Uses the **first polygon** as the main shape
2. Subtracts all **subsequent polygons** as holes from the main polygon
3. Outputs a single polygon with all the holes cut out

This is particularly useful when you need to exclude certain areas from a larger boundary (e.g., excluding parks from a canvassing district).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system (version 14 or higher recommended)
- Basic familiarity with command line/terminal

## Installation

1. Navigate to the script directory:
```bash
cd path/to/script/folder
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
npm install @turf/turf @turf/difference
```

## Input File Requirements

You need to create an `input.geojson` file in the same folder as the script with the following structure:

- **First feature**: Your main polygon (the base shape)
- **Subsequent features**: All polygons you want to subtract as holes

### Example input.geojson structure:
```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[[...]]]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[[...]]]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important**: The order matters! The first polygon is your main shape, all others will be cut out from it.

## How to Run

1. Place your `input.geojson` file in the same folder as `index.js`

2. Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd path/to/script/folder
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
node index.js
```

4. The script will create an `output.geojson` file in the same folder

## Post-Processing for eCanvasser

After running the script:

1. Go to [geojson.io](http://geojson.io)
2. Drag and drop (or open) the `output.geojson` file
3. Verify the polygon looks correct with holes properly cut out
4. Click **Save** â†’ **GeoJSON** to download the finalized version
5. This finalized file is now ready to upload to eCanvasser

## Troubleshooting

**"Difference returned null. Skipping this hole."**
- This means a hole polygon doesn't intersect with the main polygon
- The script will skip it and continue processing other holes

**"Cannot find module '@turf/turf'"**
- Run `npm install @turf/turf @turf/difference` in the script folder

**"Cannot find input.geojson"**
- Ensure `input.geojson` is in the same folder as `index.js`
- Check the filename spelling and case sensitivity

**Empty or invalid output**
- Check that your first polygon in `input.geojson` is the main boundary
- Verify all polygons are valid GeoJSON Polygon geometry

## Script Output

The script provides console output showing:
- Which feature is being processed
- Whether each subtraction succeeded
- The final polygon structure

The final result is saved to `output.geojson` in the same directory.

## Notes

- The script processes holes sequentially, so order matters if holes overlap each other
- All input polygons must be valid GeoJSON Polygon features
- The output will be a single Feature (not a FeatureCollection)
